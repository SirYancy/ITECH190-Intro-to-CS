# HTML/CSS

## Introduction

A modern web site is a complex, many-layered, interactive application. Unlike any other software development, web development needs to leverage many different technologies, programming languages, frameworks, and software stacks in order to work and give the user the sort of experience which will draw them back time and time again.

For example, a simple hosted WordPress blog requires a server (like Apache), a server backend (like cpanel), a WordPress installation, and extensive coding in four different programming lanugages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP. And this is just for a basic weblog!

That said, in addition to this, with the development of a massive array of tools and utilities, never before has it been _easier_ to set up, edit, and maintain a website. Often, you never even need to actually write a line of code or even know a single programming language.

The primary goal of this course is to learn fundamental concepts in computer science. However, in that process, we will learn about some of the tools and utilities that real developers use to build real websites. Tools that you can use now, today, to build websites, add interactivity, and style them up.

We'll start with HTML.
