# What is Computing?

Computing as an idea is not new. In fact, in many ways, it predates humanity. There is a perception that computing is all about weird nerds in their basements banging out arcane codes in binary and hacking into mainframes. And yes, to some extent, that trope does exist. However, that aside, nothing could be more natural than looking at the world and trying to make sense of it. Computing the study of **information**. It asks the questions "What is information?", "How can we can we use information?", and "How do we process it?"

## Who does Computing?

There are five broad disciplines that are involved with computing. Within these, there are many, many sub-disciplines, but this breakdown covers about all of it.

* **Computer Science** - The computer scientist is the philosopher of computing. Computer science asks the qeuestions "What can be computed?" and also "What cannot be computed?". The explore the theory of computing and the development of computational procedures called **algorithms**. The computer scientist analyzes algorithms to determine how long they take to run and how much memory they would need to do their job. She also designs programming languages, analyzes complex systems, and explores the human-computer relationship and the challenges associated with it.
* **Computer Engineering** - Computer engineers explore the
