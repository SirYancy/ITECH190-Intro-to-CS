# What is Computing?

Computing as an idea is not new. In fact, in many ways, it predates humanity. There is a perception that computing is all about weird nerds in their basements banging out arcane codes in binary and hacking into mainframes. And yes, to some extent, that trope does exist. However, that aside, nothing could be more natural than looking at the world and trying to make sense of it. Computing the study of **information**. It asks the questions "What is information?", "How can we can we use information?", and "How do we process it?"
