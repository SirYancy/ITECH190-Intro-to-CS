# JavaScript
## The workhorse of interactive Web development

JavaScript is _the_ Web programming language. There are some pretty neat things that you can do with pure HTML/CSS, however, to add functionality to a Web page, you are going to need JavaScript. It's a fast, interpreted language that is constantly being added to and expanded. Indeed, if there's any kind of functionality that you would like to add to a web page, chances are, someone has already built a nice, convenient library for it in JavaScript.

This text focuses on JavaScript, however, it is important to understand that our primary goal is to look at programming languages more in the abstract. The fact that you will learn some basic practical skills with one of the most popular languages in the industry today is a happy biproduct. Our goal is to look at programming as an idea and then look at how some problem can be solved in JavaScript.

As you grow as a programmer, you may want to look back over this text (it will remain available hopefully for the forseeable future for free) and imagine how you might solve these problems with new languages that you have learned. Or how you might expand on the functionality of some of these solutions. Now, let's get started

Remember to refer to the [demo page](http://itech190.erickuha.com) for some examples.
