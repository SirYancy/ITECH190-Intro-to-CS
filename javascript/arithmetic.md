# Basic Arithmetic

There is a reason that when people look at a computer and think of computer scientists, that they think of math and numbers and arcane algebraic symbols. Computers are, at their core, math machines. At the core of everything that a computer does is arithmetic.

Most of the programs that we have written so far have been designed to manipulate text. So let's take a look at how we can do some actual math. As it turns out, in JS mathematical operations are very intuitive.

## The Basics

Open up a JS console like [squarefree]. Let's try a few things.

```javascript
5 + 12;
a = 5;
b = 12;
