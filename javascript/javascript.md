# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language developed in the 90s. Unlike HTML, which is just a markup language, used to take plain text and give it structure, JavaScript is actually for writing programs.

Specifically, it is a **high-level**, **dynamic**, **interpreted**language.

## High-Level Language

JavaScript is a **high-level** language, which means that it is heavily abstracted away from the bare metal of the computer. In order to access the computer hardware, it relies on many systems and lots of software to get there. High-level languages are typically far easier to use and are often kind of like writing natural language, unlike machine language (which is just 1s and 0s) or assembly languages (which are *very* hard to read and understand).

High-level languages are where almost all computer scientists begin their explorations of software and computer systems. And many never really have much need to explore much deeper.

## Dynamic Language

High-level languages are written in human-friendly syntax. But what's good for a human to read, write, and understand is not necessarily so great for a computer. Remember, computers *only* understand 1s and 0s. Some high-level languages overcome this through the use of a compiler. That is, after you, the programmer, writes the program, it is run through *another* program called a compiler that translates it into machine language (or something closer to it).

Dynamic languages, on the other hand, are not compiled until they are run. They execute many of their behaviors at run-time. That is, it's just plain old code until the program is loaded into its **interpreter**. An interpreter is a piece of software that executes the code of a dynamic language.
